# pg_isready returns 0 to the shell if the server is accepting connections
# normally, 1 if the server is rejecting connections (for example during
# startup), 2 if there was no response to the connection attempt, and 3 if no
# attempt was made (for example due to invalid parameters).
#
# The options --dbname and --username are used to avoid gratuitous
# error messages in the logs, but are not necessary for proper
# functionality.
#
# We return CRITICAL if we can't connect as well as if the server is
# rejecting connections (not yet ready).
